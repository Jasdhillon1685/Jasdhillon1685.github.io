            <p class="homepage"> I am a  Wife and a Mother of 3. I have always wanted to be a Computer Engineer, but because of financial issues i could not pursue my dream. Until i found MEDA. I am currently taking classes as a Web Designer with MEDA. I have gained a lot of knowledge and I will use the knowledge that I gain right now to pursue my career in Web Designing in the future. My goals with Web Designing is to pursue a career of designing websites for big companies like Google, IBM, Apple. Web designing for me is also step ONE to fulfiling my dream of becoming a Computer Engineer. <br><br>

                I would also like to use this education to help my kids in their future. Since I started this Class, I kept thinking that this is not for me. I am too old for this. But I stood my grounds and Today here I stand to let everyone especially myself know that no matter what your age is, You can do anything if you set your mind to it.  </p>
