        <h2 class="h2">Hello There, My name is  Jasdeep (Shevy).</h2>
            <p class="homepage"> I am a  Wife and a Mother of 3. I have always wanted to be a Computer Engineer, but because of financial issues i could not pursue my dream. Until i found MEDA. I am currently taking classes as a Web Designer with MEDA. I have gained a lot of knowledge and I will use the knowledge that I gain right now to pursue my career in Web Designing in the future. My goals with Web Designing is to pursue a career of designing websites for big companies like Google, IBM, Apple. Web designing for me is also step ONE to fulfulling my dream of becoming a Computer Engineer. <br><br>

                I would also like to use this education to help my kids in their future. Since i started this Class, because of the ethnicity background i belong from, I kept getting told that you can not do this, You are too old for this. This is your age to think about the future of your kids and not yours. But I stood my grounds and Today here I stand to let everyone especially my Kids know that no matter what your age is, You can do anything if you set your mind to it.  </p>
